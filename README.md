## Predicting Stock Market Movements using LSTM
- Predicting stock prices using LSTM and TensorFlow from Yahoo’s Finance API is a challenging yet interesting task. LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network that can capture long-term dependencies in sequential data, such as stock prices. TensorFlow is a popular framework for building and training deep learning models.
- To predict stock prices using LSTM and TensorFlow, you need to follow these steps:
- Download the historical stock data from Yahoo’s Finance API using the yfinance library in Python.
- Preprocess the data, such as scaling, splitting, and reshaping, to make it suitable for the LSTM model.
- Create and compile an LSTM model using TensorFlow’s Keras API. You can customize the number of layers, units, activation functions, and loss functions according to your needs.
- Train the model on the training data and evaluate its performance on the test data using metrics such as mean squared error or root mean squared error.
- Use the model to make predictions on new or unseen data and visualize the results using plots or charts.
